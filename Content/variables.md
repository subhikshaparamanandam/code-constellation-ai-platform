# Python Variables


## What is a Variable?

A variable is a name given to a value. It is used to store data so we can use it later in our program.

Think of a variable like a labeled box:
* The label is the variable name
* The item inside the box is the value

### Example
If a box is labeled `age` and contains `20`, then:
```python
age = 20
```

## Why Do We Need Variables?
Variables help us:
* Store information
* Reuse values
* Make programs easier to understand
* Without variables, we would have to repeat values again and again.

## Example in Python
```python
name = "Sanjai"
age = 21
is_student = True

print(name)
print(age)
print(is_student)
```

Here:
* `name` stores a text value
* `age` stores a number
* `is_student` stores True or False

## Rules for Variable Names
* Must start with a letter or underscore
* Cannot start with a number
* Should not contain spaces
* Use meaningful names

**✅ Good:** `total_marks = 450`
**❌ Bad:** `1total = 450`

## Practice Task
Create variables for:
1. Your name
2. Your college name
3. Your year of study

Print all the variables.
