# Python Loops


## What is a Loop?

A loop is used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

**Real-world example:**
If you want to say “Hello” 5 times, you don’t write it 5 times — you use a loop.

## for Loop Example
```python
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello")
```
This will print "Hello" 5 times.

### Loop with Numbers
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```
**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

## Why Loops Are Important
* Reduce code length
* Save time
* Useful in data processing

## Practice Task
Write a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
